## Bussiness: Activies Addressing Mental Health Needs

Wysa aims to address the limitations of traditional mental health care like limited accessibility and lack of immediate support. Ascessibility issues range from cost, limited resources depending on the area and stigmas. All of which can preven people from seeking help. Even when people are already in therapy they can often require assistance in between sessions.

Their target customers are those who are experiencing mild to moderate mental health concerns. People who have anxiety, stress, depression are the main concern. While, again, those who might be hesitant because of cost stigma or convience are also encouraged to participate.

There is not an easy answer when it comes to the market size for Wyas's target audience. However we can look at some statistics to give us a good idea of the possible reach.
  -The global mental health market is estimated to reach USD 343 Billion by 2027 (Include link). A significant portion of the population experiences a form of mental health issue (Source) and the growing awareness of mental health and increasing adoption of digital health solutions suggest a large potential market for the company.

Wysa has quite a few potential advantages when it comes to the market of telehealth. First they have accessibility and affordability. They offer a convinient and lower-cost alternative to regular therapy. Second is there anonymity. Stigmas surrounding mental health can be a barrier to many who should seek it. Being able annoymouisly access an app makes it easier for patients to get the help they need. The app is also availible 24/7 allowing care to be delivered at all times. 

Wysa mainly leverages four technologies. Conversational AI, Emotional Intelligence Algorythyms, Machine Learning and Data Analytics. Conversational AI lets Wyas interacti with its users in a natural way similar to current LLM's. The company can also analyze user inputs to respond accordingly with the AI. In addition they track the users progress using data analytics to improve its effectiveness. Machine learning enables them to personalize the user experience and provide targeted support.

## Landscape

Wysa is operating in the field of Digital Mental Health. The area focuses on leveraging technology to deliver mental health suppoort, information and services(cite)

There are quite a few innovations for this field in the last decade. Arguably the most important is smart phones. Their has been an unprecedented rise in mobile health(cite). Phones are excellent tools for delivering mental health interventions. The Wysa app offers convinience on many different levels. This has also excelerated the rise in tele health. This innovation has allowed people to connect to doctors and therapits virtually almost anywhere they are. Lastly is the growth of Ai powered solutions and Data Analytics. Chatbots and other AI powered tools have gained major traction. Not only does this increase accessibility but it also allows the company to use the data for personalized interventions to improve effectiveness and behavioral outcomes.

With a great market comes many great competitors. There are some big movers in the Digital Mental Health Field. Here is a list of a few of them and what they specialize in.

Talkspace & Betterhelp. They offer online therapy with licensed therapist.

Calm and Headspace. They specialize in mindfulness meditation and relaxtion thecniques

Woebot Health & Youper. Uses chatbots based on CBT(define) techniques to manage anxiety and depression

Libero.ai & Koko Health. Offering Ai-powered coaching and support for mental health.

Spring Health & Lyra health. Which provies empoyer-sponsered access to digital mental health platforms.

## Rseults

Wysa has reported significant engagement with their app. Having facilitated over 550 million conversations across 60 countries. (https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/inside-wysa/wysa-to-launch-global-employee-mental-health-report-at-world-economic-forum). In addition to this they have secured two partnerships with major goverments. Such as the NHS (United Kingdom) and Singapores Ministry of Health (cite). Recentally the FDA has given them approval for an assesment for faster access to the United States. Which would increase the reach of the company significantly.

The main metrics used in the Digital Mental Health Market are: User engagement, satisfaction, clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness and market share. Given the amount of conversations facilitated and partnerships with goverment they appear to be doing quite well in the area. Given that information when we consider how they are preforming compared to their competitors: User base is high (550 Million), credibility and reach are established (NHS, Singapore, FDA) and their focus on technology instead of human therapists would lead to the conclusion that they are preforming well.

## Recommendations

My reccomendation would be to either tap into or assemble a team of well qualified therapists for emergency situations. While it is clear that this technology is extremely accessable. The people who are coming to it are far more likely than the average person to need immediate help from a human being. Even if the end result of a conversation with a AI sends you to a suicide hotline Wysa still ends up being possibly the last step towards someone elses catastrophic descion. Addmittedly this is not a new piece of technology. However, to avoid any liability (which all companies face at some point) it would make sense to make sure they have a stop gap in place to mitigate it.
