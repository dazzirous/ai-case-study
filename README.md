# Bussiness: Activies Addressing Mental Health Needs

Wysa aims to address the limitations of traditional mental health care like limited accessibility and lack of immediate support. Ascessibility issues range from cost, limited resources depending on the area and stigmas. All of which can preven people from seeking help. Even when people are already in therapy they can often require assistance in between sessions.

Their target customers are those who are experiencing mild to moderate mental health concerns. People who have anxiety, stress, depression are the main concern. While, again, those who might be hesitant because of cost stigma or convience are also encouraged to participate.

There is not an easy answer when it comes to the market size for Wyas's target audience. However we can look at some statistics to give us a good idea of the possible reach.
  -The global mental health market is estimated to reach USD 343 Billion by 2027 (Include link). A significant portion of the population experiences a form of mental health issue (Source) and the growing awareness of mental health and increasing adoption of digital health solutions suggest a large potential market for the company.

Wysa has quite a few potential advantages when it comes to the market of telehealth. First they have accessibility and affordability. They offer a convinient and lower-cost alternative to regular therapy. Second is there anonymity. Stigmas surrounding mental health can be a barrier to many who should seek it. Being able annoymouisly access an app makes it easier for patients to get the help they need. The app is also availible 24/7 allowing care to be delivered at all times. 

Wysa mainly leverages four technologies. Conversational AI, Emotional Intelligence Algorythyms, Machine Learning and Data Analytics. Conversational AI lets Wyas interacti with its users in a natural way similar to current LLM's. The company can also analyze user inputs to respond accordingly with the AI. In addition they track the users progress using data analytics to improve its effectiveness. Machine learning enables them to personalize the user experience and provide targeted support.
